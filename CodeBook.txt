This project includes 3 files in addition to this CodeBook.txt;
README.md		description of the code in the run_analysis.R function
run_analysis.R		R function that reads data from a defined data set and produces two tidy data sets, one of which is saved
tidy_data.txt		saved copy of the summary_data table generated by run_analysis function

Table acceleration_data

Set of summary measurements for a series of subjects doing a range of activities. Each row contains one obervation. For each observation there are four data fields;
subject: numeric reference to the subject taking the test
activity: brief description of the activity being undertaken
average: mean of the measured acceleration data for the observation
standardD: standard deviation of the measured acceleration data for the observation

Table summary_data

Set of summary data comprising the mean acceleration data for each subject undertaking each activity in the acceleration_data table (i.e. if subject "1" completes the "Walking" task 4 times, this table records the mean of the mean acceleration of those observations). For each record there are 3 data fields;
subject: numeric reference to the subject taking the test
activity: brief description of the activity being undertaken
average: mean of the measured acceleration data for each subject undertaking each activity

A copy of the summary_data table is written to a text file called tidy_data.txt
